## Your Favorite Letterboxd Discord Bot

Most people visiting this page will only
want [this link to invite the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=794271558570213409&permissions=2147764224&scope=applications.commands%20bot)
and the rest of this document won't be of interest.

The source code for this bot is made available for you to take a peak under the hood and see how it all runs. Everything
here is released as AGPLv3 so if you want to use or modify this project then the source code for your entire project
must similarly be released. Likely you don't want this source code anyway as it is heavily dependent on gaining access
to the Letterboxd API (that is becoming increasingly difficult) and running on the GCP infrastructure (not everybody's
favorite choice).

If you find the bot valuable to the community you have created on your servers please consider subscribing to
the [Filmlinkd Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/filmlinkd) or making a one time donation on
the [Filmlinkd Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/filmlinkd). It's the only thing that covers the costs of keeping the bot online.

The technical details may be a bit overwhelming if you aren't interested in that sort of thing. User
facing [documentation](https://jimlind.github.io/filmlinkd/) is available that will answer most of your questions. If
you want to follow up with something specific join [the Discord Server](https://discord.gg/deZ7EUguge) and post in the
appropriate channel.

## Installation Instructions

To install the bot on your server use an admin account and authorize it
using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=794271558570213409&permissions=2147764224&scope=applications.commands%20bot).  
That link appeared twice above but it never hurts to make things extremely clear.
