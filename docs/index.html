            <h2>Recommended Installation Instructions</h2>
            <p>It is why you are here right?</p>
            <h3>1. Secure Your Server</h3>
            <p>
                You shouldn't install ANY Discord bots until you have taken the time to evaluate the risks associated
                with it. Bots are treated the same as your friends so they can read EVERY message posted in any channel
                that they are in. Bots can easily accidentally also be given permissions
                that allow them to take over your server so think about how much you trust them.
            </p>
            <p>
            	<strong>Optional</strong></br>
            	If you are running a public server and expect new regular users you will want to install a bot that supports autoroles.
            	I think that <a href="https://discordyui.net/">Yui</a> is great for autoroles and works even if you give it minimum "Manage Roles" permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a role for humans/users/etc or reuse a role that you have for actual people. Grant that role the ability to
                "View Channels."
            </p>
            <img class="d-block img-fluid mx-auto mb-4 rounded" src="images/installation/permissions-humans.png" />
            <p>Edit the role for @everyone and remove the ability to "View Channels."</p>
            <img class="d-block img-fluid mx-auto mb-4 rounded" src="images/installation/permissions-everyone.png" />
            <p>If the rest of your roles are set to defaults every channel is now a robot free zone. This is good.</p>
            <h3>2. Create a Channel</h3>
            <p>
                You don't want the bot to interrupt actual conversations so give it it's own channel to live in. Call
                the channel something like #letterboxd-feed or #diary-feed.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Authorize the Bot</h3>
            <div class="col text-center">
                <a
                    class="btn btn-primary btn-lg mb-4"
                    href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=794271558570213409&scope=bot"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Authorize Filmlinkd</a
                >
            </div>
            <h3>4. Put the Bot to Work</h3>
            <p>Add the bot to the new channel and make sure it has the ability to "View Channel"</p>

            <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>How quickly should I see new diary entries post in my channel?</dt>
                <dd>
                    It should be somewhere between 20-60 minutes. If you haven't seen it post in 2 hours, something is probably wrong.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>What permissions does this bot need?</dt>
                <dd>
                    "View Channel," "Send Messages," and "Embed Links" are the only permissions this bot needs. "View Channel" gives it
                    the ability to read your follow/unfollow commands. "Send Messages" with "Embed Links" gives it the ability to post
                    your diary entries in a format that isn't just a text blob.
                </dd>

            <dl>
                <dt>Should I really be concerned about what bots I run?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes! A bot that is running in a channel can record every message (including photos and videos)
                    posted there.
