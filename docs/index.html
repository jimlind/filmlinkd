        <h2>Recommended Installation Instructions</h2>
        <p>It is why you are here right?</p>
        <h3>1. Secure Your Server</h3>
        <p>You should not install ANY Discord bots until you have taken the time to evaluate the risks associated with it. Bots are 
          treated the same as your friends so they can read EVERY message posted in any channel that they are in. If you give Bots
          additional permissions you should take a close look at what you are allowing them to do and think about how much you trust them.</p>
        <p>Create a role for humans or reuse a role that you have for actual people. Grant that role the ability to "View Channels."</p>
        <p>Edit the role for @everyone and remove the ability to "View Channels."</p>
        <p>Unless other roles have other overrides none of your bots should be in any channels. Every channel is a robot free zone.
          This is good.</p>
        <h3>2. Create a Channel</h3>
        <p>You don't want the bot to interrupt your other riviting conversations so give it it's own channel to live in. Call the channel
          something like #letterboxd-feed or #diary-feed.</p>
        <h3>3. Authorize the Bot</h3>
        <p>I'll put a link here. Also a big button because buttons look good in bootstrap.</p>
