NEED
* Why are all footers caleb_v's footer?
* Fix all the sniffs and lints
* Move data to the v6 database.

DONE
* Delete all existing infrastructure and let terraform build it fresh
* Use STANDARD network tier
* Setup Network so there is one external ip address for the network
* Ensure local development is using the new v6 account
* Fix database access
* Ensure that memory can be reported from VM usage
* Clear the user list on a timer to rebuild for the scraper
* Revisit all the try/catches I deleted
* Wire Up Scraper Message Sending Completely
* Scraper should receive command message and know that follows are added
* Move back to the default database name to take advantage of free tier credits
* Optimize Entry API to stop parsing earlier (not checking all 10 entries)
* Watched and Reviewed text in entries is backwards
* Create VIP Scraper
* Ensure that charts/reports are duplicated in google console
* Post an actual diary entry as the last part of Help:Test
* Post a permissions status message with Help
* Retest with multiple server shards
* Keep the same scraping limits in place as current production
* Can I pass exception as cause of logs and see it in logs?
* Can you DM the bot?

DATA TRANSFER PROCESS
* Shut down original Filmlinkd VMs
* Open Cloud Shell (could do this in the terminal, but naw)
* > gsutil mb -l us gs://filmlinkd-export-bucket-us/
   Databases are in different regions so we need keep the bucket in the broad "US" region.
* Give both service-849234463174@gcp-sa-firestore.iam.gserviceaccount.com and
   service-888325130733@gcp-sa-firestore.iam.gserviceaccount.com the "Firestore Service Agent" and "Storage Object Admin"
   roles. It's a bit overkill, but save us later.
* > gcloud firestore export gs://filmlinkd-export-bucket-us --project=letterboxd-bot
   This command should finish in a couple seconds
* > gcloud config set project filmlinkd
* > gcloud firestore import gs://filmlinkd-export-bucket-us/2025-08-23T13:25:54_83989 --project=filmlinkd
   This will overwrite any existing data
   Use the real timestamp
