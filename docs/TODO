NEED
* Create VIP Scraper
* Ensure that charts/reports are duplicated in google console
* Post an actual diary entry as the last part of Help:Test
* Post a permissions status message with Help
* Retest with multiple server shards
* Watched and Reviewed text in entries is backwards
* Keep the scraping limits in place
* Can we make it compile to a specific location and then get the specific rename, so modules can be compiled at the same time
* Can I pass exception as cause of logs and see it in logs?

DONE
* Delete all existing infrastructure and let terraform build it fresh
* Use STANDARD network tier
* Setup Network so there is one external ip address for the network
* Ensure local development is using the new v6 account
* Fix database access
* Ensure that memory can be reported from VM usage
* Clear the user list on a timer to rebuild for the scraper
* Revisit all the try/catches I deleted
* Wire Up Scraper Message Sending Completely
* Scraper should receive command message and know that follows are added
* Move back to the default database name to take advantage of free tier credits
* Optimize Entry API to stop parsing earlier (not checking all 10 entries)
